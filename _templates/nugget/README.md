To write a tutorial good enough to be posted on our site, you should follow these guidelines:

# Structure

## Frontmatter

\--- <br>
The frontmatter is enclosed by three dashes. See template.<br>
\---

Here is where you add the metadata of your nugget. This is including the author, title of nugget, compatible libraries, compatible hardware etc.

You must fill in title, description and author. The others are voluntary. **Note** that you must remove the sections in the frontmatter which are empty.

## Introduction

This is an h2 heading.

The Introduction to the tutorial should be a maximum of three sentences long and be well descriptive of what the reader can expect of the nugget.

You are not allowed to change the name of the heading.
