To write a tutorial good enough to be posted on our site, you should follow these guidelines:

# Structure

## Frontmatter

\--- <br>
The frontmatter is enclosed by three dashes. See template.<br>
\---

Here is where you add the metadata of your nugget. This is including the author, title of nugget, compatible libraries, compatible hardware etc.

You must fill in title, description and author. The others are voluntary. **Note** that you must remove the sections in the frontmatter which are empty.

## Introduction

This is an h2 heading.

The Introduction to the tutorial should be a maximum of three sentences long and be well descriptive of what the reader can expect of the nugget.

You are not allowed to change the name of the heading.

## Hardware & Software Needed

This is an h2 heading.

Here you set the hardware and software you need to continue your nugget. You are more than welcome to link the Arduino based software and hardware to the respective store or downloads page.

You are not allowed to change the name of the heading.

## Code

This is an h2 heading.

This is where you add your sketch code as well as the descriptive text explaining what the code does and is used for.

You are not allowed to change the name of the heading.

## Learn more

This is an h2 heading.

This is where you link to more information that the reader could be interested in. This could for example be other tutorials that delve deeper into the same topic, or a project that focus on the learnings of this nugget.

You are not allowed to change the name of the heading.
