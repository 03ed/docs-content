The [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/) has support for events and callbacks. This can be used to trigger specific functionalities depending on what state your device is in. 

You can for example trigger a specific block of code whenever the board is in a connecting, synchronized or disconnected state. In this brief document, we will explore how to set it up, using an example from the [ArduinoIoTCloud](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud/blob/master/examples/ArduinoIoTCloud-Callbacks/ArduinoIoTCloud-Callbacks.ino) library.   

## Full Example

The example below demonstrates the available callback 

## Summary

In this article, we have covered how to use variables in the Arduino IoT Cloud, and what variables are available.
