The [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/) has different sets of APIs that provide different functionalities. This article serves as an introduction to how to work and what you can achieve with them.

## What you can achieve
Arduino IoT Cloud API allows you to build a large range of IoT solutions: from simple device data communication to building complex custom IoT solutions. Some examples are:

- Connect your Arduino or 3rd party Devices to the Cloud to monitor and control them, leveraging easy-to-use dashboards in minutes
- Build your Gateways that poll data from local devices (ex.BLE, Zigbee) and send it to the Cloud
- Develop your custom web or mobile application that leverages Arduino IoT Cloud infrastructure to handle device connectivity without worrying about protocols, security, data formats, scaling servers...
- Automate and integrate different IoT Solutions with a single, powerful Cloud 

## Two Different Sets of API

There are two different API types to consider when working with the Arduino IoT Cloud: 

**1. Applications API** - a set of powerful and flexible APIs that allows you to create and manage IoT resources like dashboards, devices, things, and variables, along with the retrieval and handling of historical data coming from your IoT Devices. The core of those APIs is organized around  [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts  [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms)  request bodies, returns  [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. You can use those APIs, both directly calling our HTTP endpoints or using our clients that wrap those calls into easy-to-use abstractions like objects and functions. We have Applications API clients available in `javascript`, `golang`, and `python`.

**2. Monitor and Control API** - a set of libraries that allow sending and receiving any kind of data (sensors' values, commands for actuators, configuration changes...) from and to IoT Devices and the Cloud. Under the hood, they

- take care of the data exchange with our MQTT broker
- handle best in class authentication & security 
- manage compression, data format, and transport protocols

Inside this set of API, we have:
	
- An official Arduino IoT Cloud Library for your Arduino sketches: `ArduinoIoTCloud.h` 
- An NPM Javascript package: `arduino-iot-js`  


## Applications API
To use the Applications API, you need to create an **API Key** in the [API Keys](https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/api-keys) section.

For more examples and detailed instructions, visit the links below:
- [Applications API Technical Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/iot/api/) - the complete REST API documentation with hundreds of examples.

- [Arduino IoT Cloud Applications API Guide](/arduino-cloud/getting-started/arduino-iot-api) - a guide to using the API with JavaScript, Python & Golang.

## Arduino IoT Cloud Sketch library
As described above, is the Arduino library that allows your Arduino devices to connect and exchange data with the IoT Cloud. If you edit your sketch directly inside IoT Cloud or Cloud Editor, you don't need to install it: it comes out of the box.

You can find more details at:

- The [official repository](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoIoTCloud)
- The [cheat sheet](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/technical-reference)

## Arduino IoT JS
The `arduino-iot-js` NPM module is designed for communicating with the Arduino IoT Cloud broker using the MQTT over Websocket protocol. It is primarily used to send and receive variable values.

Example:

```js
const { ArduinoIoTCloud } = require('@arduino/arduino-iot-js');

ArduinoIoTCloud.connect(options)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Connected to Arduino IoT Cloud");
    return ArduinoIoTCloud.onPropertyValue(thingId, variableName, showUpdates = value => console.log(value));
  })
  .then(() => console.log("Callback registered"))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

- The [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arduino-iot-js) page  


## Backward Compatibility Policy

Public Arduino IoT Cloud APIs are exposing versioned endpoints and are committed to preserving compatibility with the following policies in place:
- When making a breaking change to the API signature or behavior, we will expose a new version of the endpoint.
- If we are making a change that is backward compatible with the existing version, we won't change the endpoint version.
- When introducing a new version of the API, we will preserve the previous version as deprecated for a reasonable amount of time to allow client migrations.
- We will not preserve multiple previous versions, just N-1 with respect to the current last released, hence upgrades are recommended.
- In any case, the frequency of version changes is expected to be less than once a year.
- It's also recommended that the client keeps the base URL of the API configurable because the base URL (currently api2.arduino.cc) might also change.
