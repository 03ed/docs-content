# Introduction 

This tutorial is designed to help educators introduce students to the world of Internet of Things (IoT) using Arduino IoT Templates. Templates are ready-made projects that can significantly lower the entry barrier for teaching and learning about IoT applications. Whether you’re integrating IoT into your curriculum or organizing a hackathon, these templates offer a medium to get started quickly with the basic components of a IoT project.

Arduino IoT Templates are pre-configured projects that allow users to quickly set up and deploy IoT applications. Templates help you to quickly configure your Arduino devices for the Arduino Cloud and create a dashboard based on the project in two minutes. Through [Dashboards](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/dashboard-widgets) you can easily monitor and control IoT projects through a Web interface. 

For educational purposes, **Dashboards** provide an excellent opportunity for students to learn about IoT concepts, data collection and analyses and interaction with hardware/sensors without having to build an IoT project from scratch. This reduces the time and the learning curve which gives your students a starting point to build their ideas and learning.

# Preparing for the Activity 

Once you have decided which template(s) you would like to use, we suggest you be prepared with the essentials to conduct this activity in your class. Before you begin using templates, ensure that you have the following items checked: 

✅ Hardware - Any choice of [Arduino Wifi Boards ](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4407129094546-Boards-and-shields-with-wireless-connectivity)

✅ USB Cable - Ensure you have the right one for your board 

✅ Software - Arduino Account 

✅ Good Internet Connection 

✨ Shared Space (optional - only when you are about to use the templates with your students)

✨Sensors and Actuators (optional)

***Note - if you haven't created a shared space check out this [article](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/education/shared-spaces/). Ensure that you students have their individual accounts created and have been added to the shared space that you have created.  

For our tutorial we will use the [Cloud Blink Template](https://app.arduino.cc/templates/cloud-blink) that will illustrate how to control an Arduino Board’s LED through a dashboard in the Arduino Cloud. This is a great template if you want to get started with the Arduino Cloud. After you have completed the installation, you can modify the sketch and dashboard freely.***

# Choosing a template 

Once you have logged into your account, Templates can be accessed under the **IoT templates** section from the sidebar. 

[image 02_sidebar_iot_templates]

Here you will find templates across various categories and different boards. Click on the Cloud Blink Template. 

[image 03_cloud_blink_template]

The template page will open where you will find the description of what the project does together with essential information on HW and Electronics components.

[image 04_template_description]

# Importing a Template 

Templates can be imported easily by clicking on the import button from the template description page. The process is similar to that of uploading a sketch to the arduino board.  Once the device is plugged in to your USB port, click on **IMPORT TEMPLATE**  to import the chosen IoT template.  

[Image - IMPORT TEMPLATE BUTTON]

Below the Import button, you can find information on how many [Things](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/things), [Variables](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/variables) and [Dashboards](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/dashboard-widgets) are associated with this template. The Arduino Cloud platform will handle the creation of these IoT components along with setting up the device and network for the selected template. 

[Image - 06_template_creation ]

This process involves creating the necessary components and uploading the sketch (program) to your device. 

1. Configuring your Arduino HW and adding it to the Cloud Platform
2. Creating a virtual representation of your IoT setup 
3. Assigning the right network credentials to your devices 
4. Building a dashboard with the right widgets

**Note-** The process may take up to 5 minutes. Remind students not to unplug the device during this step or close their laptops during the import process. 

Once connected, the template will become operational. For example, if using the "Cloud Blink" template, you can now control an LED remotely through the cloud interface.

# Customizing a Template 

This interface is fully customizable and you can extend this template based on your needs and creativity. If you’d like to make changes to the Dashboard by adding additional widgets, you can do so by clicking on the **Edit icon** 

[image 08_template_dashboard_edit]

Click on the Add symbol to select a widget you would like to add. 

[image 09_dashboard_add_widgets]

Once you have added the Widget you can either connect it to the available variables or you can create a new variable. For this you need to go to **Things** from your sidebar and click on the Thing that has the same name as your template 

[image 10_associated_thing]

As mentioned earlier, the Templates also creates Variables, Sketch files, Device and Network information that can be configured based on your preference. All this information can be found inside a **Thing.**

If you have worked with IoT Projects with Arduino IoT projects, you can go ahead and start customizing the templates based on your choice otherwise you can get started with https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/guides/overview/ 

# ## Using Templates for your course

Integrating Arduino IoT templates into a course curriculum offers a tangible way to teach concepts like sensor data collection, cloud computing, and IoT (Internet of Things) principles across various disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology and computer science. Here are some innovative ways a teacher can use these templates in their course

| Subject / Project     | Physics                                  | Chemistry                           | Biology                        | Comp. Science                               | Arts and Design                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| Fun and Games         |                                          |                                     |                                | Loops, Pointers, Arrays and Functions       | Emotional expressions through technology           |

As you can see some templates can be used across various disciplines and it totally depends on how you interpret them too. Creativity together with your subject matter can open up new avenues for experimentation and fun exploration for your students. 

## ### Group Projects 

Encourage students to work in groups, fostering collaboration and problem-solving skills.

For advanced students, these templates can serve as the basis for capstone projects where they design and implement a complete IoT system to solve a real-world problem.

## ### Experimenting 

Discuss how the principles learned through these projects can be applied to real-world scenarios, enhancing their understanding of IoT's impact.

After mastering the basics, challenge students to modify the templates or come up with their own IoT project ideas.

## ### Hackathons or Competitions 

Organize a hackathon where students use the templates as a starting point to innovate and create new projects or improvements. This encourages creativity, teamwork, and practical problem-solving skills.
