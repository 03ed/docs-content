## INTRODUCTION 

Do you have an idea for your project but don’t know how to execute it for your class ? Use the web editor to start creating this project. For this example we chose to go with a simple project where you can read the distance sensor and make a proximity meter. 

## HARDWARE & SOFTWARE NEEDED 
- Arduino Uno Rev2 
- RED LED 5mm 
- Piezo 
- Ultra Sonic Sense 
- Web Editor 

Note - We recommend that you read the article https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/getting-started-web-editor before you proceed with the tutorial. 

## BUILD THE PROJECT 
How about we start our project with getting the basics setup. Here we will run you through how the essentials elements for a project that will be essential for you to teach anything related to programming and electronics.

01. Create a circuit diagram
Start by thinking about the layout of your circuit. It could be as basic as a pen on paper but more the fidelity the easier it is for your students to understand how to connect the components. For this tutorial we created a circuit using tinkercad.

02. Connect the components 
Once you have created the components, its good to connect the components to ensure all the connections are right. Sometimes its also good to support your document with photos of your connections. Heres a picture of the circuit

03. Open a new Arduino Sketch 
Open the online webeditor and click on the (add new sketch file) icon to open a sketch file. Once you  

02. Project Folder 
Keeping your files organised for any project is important as it makes your life easier. Let’s start by creating a folder by clicking the new folder icon on the menu bar.

Describe your project
Give a short description of the project. In this example we will describe what the proximity sensor will do. 

Materials and Components 
Arduino Uno *1 


Installation 
Most students would be new to the web editor and they wouldn’t have the webeditor installed. Copy paste this link if would like to
