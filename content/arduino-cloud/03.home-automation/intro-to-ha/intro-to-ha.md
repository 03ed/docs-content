**Home Automation** is an exciting topic to get into, and it is all about making smart solutions using technology to "automate your home". The Arduino IoT Cloud is a service that makes it simple for you to configure, deploy, monitor and interact with your Arduino devices. 

In this article, we will list out a series of examples that could become your next Home Automation project, along with code examples, circuits and a suggestion for bill of materials. 

## Temperature / Humidity Sensor

Temperature & humidity sensing is an easy implementation that is inexpensive and quick to setup. Some common use cases are:

- **Thermostat** - activate / de-activate heating & cooling based on the temperature.
- **Plant care** - monitor and maintain the right humidity for your plants.
- **Humidity control** - monitor and alert if the humidity rate is too high in a specific room (like the basement).
- **Window check** - check temperature of rooms in e.g. larger offices. If temperature is cold it can indicate an open/broken window.

There are several temperature/humidity sensors ranging in quality and price. We recommend using the popular DHTXX sensor module, which are accurate and well documented.
