The Arduino platform has since its start in 2005, grown to become one of the most recognizable brands in the space of electronics and embedded design. 

But what are the cornerstones of Arduino? What is a "board", how do I write code to it, and what are the tools needed to create my own project? The goal with this guide is to provide you with an overview to the Arduino project.

***In this guide, you will find links to articles that goes more in depth on a specific topic.***

## Goals

This guide is divided into three main sections: **hardware**, **software tools**, and **Arduino API**. The sections just below summarizes the learning outcome of this article:

### Hardware

In this section, we will dedicate some time to learn about some fundamentals in electronics, and about a basic operation of an Arduino board.

- The anatomy of an Arduino board.
- The "basic" operation of an Arduino board.
- Fundamental knowledge of microcontrollers, electronic signals, communication protocols, memory management.
- Embedded sensors.
- Creating a circuit with external sensors and actuators.
- Internet of Things (IoT) and different radio modules & wireless protocols.

### Software IDE, Tools & Services

In this section you will how to set up your development environment as well as learning about what options there are.s

- How to set up your development environment.
- Learn about the Arduino IDEs (Integrated Development Environment).
- Learn about the Arduino Cloud Service.
- Intro to the Arduino CLI (Command Line Interface).

### The Arduino API

In this section you will learn what the Arduino API is, and how to create code that can run on your Arduino board.

- What is the "Arduino API".
- How is an Arduino program (sketch) structured.
- How do I upload code to an Arduino board?
- What is a "core/platform"?
- Core specific API.
