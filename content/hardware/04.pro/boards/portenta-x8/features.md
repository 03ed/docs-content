<Feature title="STM32H747XI dual Cortex®-M7+M4 32bit low power Arm® MCU" image="mcu">

  X8's main processor is the dual core STM32H747 including a Cortex® M7 running at 480 MHz and a Cortex® M4 running at 240 MHz. The two cores communicate via a Remote Procedure Call mechanism that allows calling functions on the other processor seamlessly.

<Feature title="Real-time applications™" image="communication">

  Thanks to the Arduino environment, the X8 offers the best of two approaches: the flexibility of usage of Linux combined with real-time applications. This approach allows developers to leverage the Arduino envornment to perform e.g automation control while performing high-performance processonf on Linuc cores at the same time. 

</Feature>

<Feature title="Containerizing system" image="configurability">

  With the so called encapsulate-application, developers can isolate a single package of software, which means that the applications can run within a controlled environment. This allow developers to design device-independent software while achieving modularization, thanks to the container composition.
