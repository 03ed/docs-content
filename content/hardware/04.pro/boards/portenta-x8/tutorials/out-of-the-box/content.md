## Connecting to the Board

Once the Portenta X8 is plugged in via USB, you can open your browser and go to http://192.168.7.1 if you use Windows and Linux or http://192.168.8.1 on MacOS. This web page is hosted on the Portenta X8, from this dashboard you will be able to:

* [Configure Wi-Fi](#connecting-to-your-wi-fi)
* [Add your device to a factory (OTA)](#add-a-new-device-to-your-factory)
* Board details
* Shell (alpine python)

## Connecting to Your Wi-Fi

Click the Wi-Fi button to start configuring your network connection.

***You can change your network by clicking on the button again and repeat the steps***

## Connect to a Factory

### Register the factory on foundries.io

Go to [https://create.arduino.cc](https://create.arduino.cc) and click on the portenta-X8 board manager, you will get prompted to set a new `Factory` name if you didn't have one before. The name will not be able to be changed later, so use one that you can remember and write easily.

![Arduino Cloud integration](assets/cloud-main.png)

It will redirect you to foundries factory registration page.

![Foundries Factory creation](assets/foundries-create-factory.png)

Then you can go to [https://app.foundries.io/factories](https://app.foundries.io/factories) and it will show the factory you just created.

![Foundries Factories](assets/foundries-factories.png)

After you have created your Foundries.io factory you need to go back to the Portenta-X8 web dashboard to add a new device into your new factory.

### Add a new device to your factory

Click the "Register Factory name" button.

![Factory connection](assets/x8-oob-factory-name.png)

The next panel gives you a code that you need to copy.

![Device factory token](assets/x8-oob-factory-register.png)

Click on the "Complete registration" button  from the Portenta X8 dashboard

The button will open the foundries activation page. Paste your token on the prompt and press continue.

![Foundries device link](assets/foundries-activation-token.png)

Confirm the addition of the new device by pressing "Connect"

![Foundries device confirmation](assets/foundries-activation-prompt.png)

Finally you will see a confirmation which means that your device now is attached to the new factory.

Once it is completed the factory button on the Portenta X8 dashboard will turn green.

#### Check your factory

Have a look to your factories by going to [Foundries factories page](https://app.foundries.io/factories)

![](assets/foundries-factories.png)

Select the factory that you want to check and it will open its dashboard.

#### Check your device

You can check that your device is fully connected inside your factory by going to the "devices" tab

Then chose the device you want to check by clicking on its box and it will open its page.

## Controlling Portenta X8 Through the Terminal

You have plenty of ways to communicate with your board, be it wirelessly or with a cable. Next we are going to show how to use adb and ssh.

### ADB

First of all make sure you have the latest **Mbed OS Portenta Core**, which contains the adb program.
You can go to its directory inside the **Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/adb/32.0.0**. To check the tool you can use your teminal and type `adb`, you should get feedback from the tool when typing this.

To know the list of devices that can be accessed type `adb devices`.

If you only see one device you can try and type `adb shell`, you are now communicating with your Portenta X8.

### SSH

SSH is commonly used for remote control on different kinds of devices running different set ups through TCP-IP.

To communicate with your board, you will need to know the IP of it, and just type `ssh fio@<IP>`, then the terminal workaround should be the same as ADB. The password is `fio`.

![SSH connection](assets/ssh-connection.png)
As it is a linux device, you can do normal stuff like creating files, changing directory, etc.

To gain admin (root) access, type `sudo su -` and the password is `fio`  after that the terminal prefix should turn red.

### Inspecting Real Time Tasks

Run: `journalctl -f` to see what's going on on the device
