## Introduction 



***Note: This tutorial was created in Sweden, and as a result, the available networks are only Swedish network operators. The results will vary depending on what location you are in.***

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

- Learn how to connect the board and the carrier.
- Connect to the GSM network with Cat-M1 or NBIoT.
- Print HTML content in the Serial Monitor.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [Portenta H7](https://store.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7)
- [Dipole Antenna](https://store.arduino.cc/antenna) (or equivalent product with the same frequency range).
- [Portenta Max carrier]()

## Instructions

### Circuit


### Arduino IDE



### Programming the Board



### Result of Sketch



### Troubleshoot

If the code is not working, there are some common issues we can troubleshoot:

- We have entered the wrong pin number.
- We are out of coverage (no signal).
- SIM card may not be activated.
