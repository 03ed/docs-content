Place the Portenta Machine Control in the bottom part of the enclosure kit. Next place the LCD screen cover over the screen. Now place the LCD screen into the middle part of the enclosure kit. To connect the screen to the carrier, plug one end of the cord into the under side of the LCD screen, the other end of the cord goes into the connector slot on the Carrier. Lastly, you can now put the upper part that holds the screen on the bottom part that holds the Carrier.
