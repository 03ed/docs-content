### Clamps on the Pole

Take the bigger clamp and introduce one screw on the hole that fits better for your pole, grab the smaller clamp and align it with the screw, after that you should take a nut and make it closer to the smaller clamp, repeat it with the other side, first just make sure everything is aligned and then fasten them properly with a screwdriver.

***The clamp is also suitable to be mounted using hose clamps (not included) you should then use the rectangular holes on the bigger clamp***
