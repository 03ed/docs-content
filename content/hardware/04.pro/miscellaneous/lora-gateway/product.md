The WisGate Edge Gateway allows you to set an industrial-grade Gateway for IoT applications. Two available versions:
* WisGate Edge Lite 2
* WisGate Edge Pro (Outdoors)

Each version needs to fit the frequency requirements of the different band zones, so you will be able to chose one out of three different compatibilities (EU, ENZ, US).
