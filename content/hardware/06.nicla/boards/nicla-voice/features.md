<FeatureDescription>

The Arduino® Nicla Voice implements always-on speech recognition on the edge. The board integrates a Neural Decision processor from Syntiant (NDP120), enabling it to run multiple AI algorithms. It also features a smart 6-axis motion sensor and a magnetometer, making it the ideal solution for ultra-low power predictive maintenance, gesture/voice recognition, and contactless applications. Following the Nicla family, it offers on-board Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity and is compatible with Nicla, Portenta, and MKR products. Thus offering 

The Nicla Voice can also be battery-powered with long-lasting autonomy making it standalone.
