The Arduino® Nicla Voice packs speech recognition capabilities on the edge into a tiny form factor. The board integrates a dedicated Neural Decision Processor **NDP120** able to run multiple AI algorithms at the same time. Leverage the built-in microphone, nRF52832 microcontroller, Bluetooth® Low Energy module,  6-axis IMU and 3-axis magnetometer to create your own wireless sensor network for machine learning applications with low power consumption capabilities.
