Please read carefully the following notes:

***Disclaimer about the risk of short-circuiting the battery when the PCB is out of the chassis. Since it is Li-Ion battery if ti is shortcircuited it can burn***

***Information about the ESD logo we need to put on the HW announcing the product is sensible to electrostatic discharge***

***Information about the screws to use next to the LEGO compatibility holes***

#### 2.2.1 NANO ESP32
The [Nano ESP32](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32) is the board used to control Alvik, it has a quick processor, large flash memory and Wi-FiÂ® enabled chip packed into a tiny circuit board.

***You can find out more about this board in the [Nano ESP32 documentation](/hardware/nano-esp32).***

Please note that when using MicroPython the pin number reflects the GPIO on the ESP32-S3, not the Nano board. Use the **green labeled number** in the following image. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/micropython/micropython-course/course/introduction-python#nano-esp32--micropython-pinout).
