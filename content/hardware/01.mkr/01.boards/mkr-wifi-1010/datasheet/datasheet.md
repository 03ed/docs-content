## Board Operation
### Getting Started - IDE
If you want to program your Arduino® Nano while offline you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]** To connect the Arduino Uno to your computer, you’ll need a Micro-B USB cable. This also provides power to the board, as indicated by the LED.

### Getting Started - Arduino Web Editor
All Arduino® boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino Web Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.
The Arduino Web Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Sample Sketches
Sample sketches for the Arduino® can be found either in the “Examples” menu in the Arduino® IDE or in the “Documentation” section of the Arduino website **[4]**

### Online Resources
Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[5]**, the Arduino® Library Reference **[6]** and the online store **[7]** where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery
All Arduino boards have a built-in bootloader which allows flashing the board via USB. In case a sketch locks up the processor and the board is not reachable anymore via USB it is possible to enter bootloader mode by double-tapping the reset button right after power up.

Exemptions : No exemptions are claimed. 

Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

### Conflict Minerals Declaration 
As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
