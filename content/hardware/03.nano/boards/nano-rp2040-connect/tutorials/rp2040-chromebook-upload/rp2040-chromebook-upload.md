## Introduction 

The [Nano RP2040 Connect]() is a popular development board packed with features. If you are using a **Chromebook**, the process of uploading sketches is a bit different. 

- It is only possible to use the [Web Editor](), an online IDE that is part of the [Arduino Cloud]().
- Compiled sketches are saved (in `.uf2` format) on the RP2040's mass storage device.

***Note that only the Web Editor is supported in Chromebooks. It is not possible to configure and upload to Nano RP2040 Connect boards via the [IoT Cloud]().***

## Goals

The goals of this project are:

- Learn how to upload sketches to your Nano RP2040 board, using the Web Editor.

## Hardware & Software Needed

- [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/).
- [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect](https://store.arduino.cc/nano-rp2040-connect).

## Web Editor

***To use the [Web Editor](), you will need to be logged into your [Arduino account](). If you don't have an account, you can [register one]().***

**1.** Head to [Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/).

**2.** Create a new sketch, and write your program.

**3.** When you want to upload, connect your board to your computer via USB.
