<FeatureDescription>

The Nano Matter combines Arduino's user-friendly approach with the powerful MGM240S technology from Silicon Labs, making it easier for Makers to work with Matter, a popular standard for connecting IoT devices, in a very compact design.

Using Nano's small form factor, Arduino makes it simpler for Makers to use Silicon Lab's technology, making working with Matter-compatible devices more straightforward than ever. With the Nano Matter:

- Makers can create devices that connect and communicate with other devices that use Matter.
- Makers can update their existing Nano projects to become smart home devices.
- Makers can also try out different communication standards like Zigbee® and OpenThread®.
