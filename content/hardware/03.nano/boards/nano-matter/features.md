<FeatureDescription>

The Nano Matter combines Arduino's ease of use with Silicon Labs's powerful [MGM240S](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/mgm240s-datasheet.pdf) chip, making the popular IoT connectivity standard, **Matter**, more accessible for various applications, including domotics and building automation. Its versatile connectivity options, including Bluetooth® Low Energy and Openthread®, make it ideal for projects requiring low-power efficiency and broad connectivity.

Using Nano's small form factor, Arduino makes it simpler for Makers to use Silicon Lab's technology, making working with Matter-compatible devices more straightforward than ever through its ample peripherals and I/Os, opening up new possibilities in smart technology for makers and professionals. With the Nano Matter:

- Create, connect, and communicate with Matter-compatible devices with a user-friendly coding interface.
- Upgrade Arduino Nano projects to smart home applications using multiple connectivity options like 802.15.4 Thread® and Bluetooth® Low Energy in a compact form factor.
- Experiment with multiple communication protocols, including [Zigbee®](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/) and [OpenThread®](https://openthread.io/), making it an ideal prototyping tool for scalable professional applications.
- Protect your projects against digital threats thanks to enhanced security with the embedded Secure Vault® technology.
- Benefit from always-on data processing capabilities thanks to low power consumption, ensuring your projects are efficient and responsive.
- Start debugging easily using the debugging over the USB feature, simplifying the troubleshooting process for a smoother development experience.
