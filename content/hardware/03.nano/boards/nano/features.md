<FeatureDescription>

The classic Nano is the oldest member of the Arduino Nano family boards. It is similar to the Arduino Duemilanove but made for the use of a breadboard and has no dedicated power jack. Successors of the classic Nano are for example the Nano 33 IoT featuring a WiFi module or the Nano 33 BLE Sense featuring Bluetooth® Low Energy and several environment sensors.

<Feature title="I2C Protocol" image="communication">

  I2C is a communication protocol which can be used to set up communication between two boards using a Reader/Peripheral Sender configuration. Several 
  functions of Arduino’s Wire library are used to accomplish this.
