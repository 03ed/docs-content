Here you will find the technical specifications for the ArduinoÂ® Nano 33 IoT.

**Please read: operating voltage**

The microcontroller on the **Arduino Nano ESP32** runs at 3.3V, which means that you must never apply more than 3.3V to its Digital and Analog pins. Care must be taken when connecting sensors and actuators to assure that this limit of 3.3V is never exceeded. Connecting higher voltage signals, like the 5V commonly used with the other Arduino boards, will damage the Nano ESP32.

Note that this board does not have a 5V pin, instead, it has a VUSB pin. The VUSB pin provides 5V as long as it is powered via USB. Powering via VIN will not enable the VUSB pin, meaning you have no option to receive 5V unless powered with USB. For communication with 5V devices, you can opt to use a logic level translator.
