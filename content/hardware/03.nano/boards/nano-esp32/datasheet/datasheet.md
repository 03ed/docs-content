# Description 
The Arduino® Nano ESP32 (with and without headers) is a Nano form factor board based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller unit (MCU). This is the first Arduino board to be based fully on an ESP32 MCU, and features Wi-Fi, Bluetooth® LE, debugging via native USB in the Arduino IDE as well as low power.

The Nano ESP32 is compatible with the Arduino IoT Cloud, and has support for MicroPython. It is an ideal board for getting started with IoT development.

## The Board

Nano ESP32 is a 3.3V development board based on the ESP32-S3 system on a chip (SoC). It features

As all Nano form factor boards, Nano ESP32 does not have a battery charger but can be powered through USB or headers.

### Application Examples
**Weather station:** Using the Arduino Nano 33 IoT or Nano 33 IoT with headers together with a sensor and a OLED display, we can create a small weather station communicating temperature, humidity etc. directly  to your phone.

**Air quality monitor:** Bad air quality may have serious effects on your health. By assembling the board, with a sensor and monitor you can make sure that the air quality is kept in indoor-environments. By connecting the hardware assembly to an IoT application/API, you will receive real time values.

**Air drum:** A quick and fun project is to create a small air drum. Connect your board and upload your sketch from the Create Web Editor and start creating beats with your audio workstation of your choice.
