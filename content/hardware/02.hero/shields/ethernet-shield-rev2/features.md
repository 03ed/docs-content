<FeatureDescription>


The Arduino Ethernet Shield 2 connects your Arduino to the internet in mere minutes. Just plug this module onto your Arduino Board, connect it to your network with an RJ45 cable and follow a few simple steps to start controlling your world through the internet. As always with Arduino, every element of the platform – hardware, software and documentation – is freely available and open-source. This means you can learn exactly how it's made and use its design as the starting point for your own circuits. The shield is TinkerKit compatible, which means you can quickly create projects by plugging TinkerKit modules to the board.
