<FeatureDescription>

The **Arduino 9 Axis Motion Shield** is based on the BNO055 absolute orientation sensor from Bosch Sensortec GmbH which integrates a triaxial 14-bit accelerometer, a triaxial 16-bit gyroscope with a range of Â±2000 degrees per second and a triaxial geomagnetic sensor with a 32-bit microcontroller running the BSX3.0 FusionLib software.

BNO055 sensor features three-dimensional acceleration, yaw rate, and magnetic field strength data each in 3
perpendicular axes. It also provides the sensor fusion signals such as **quaternion, euler angles, rotation vector, linear acceleration,** and **gravity vector.**
