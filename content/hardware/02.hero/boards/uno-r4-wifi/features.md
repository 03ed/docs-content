<FeatureDescription>

The Arduino UNO R4 WiFi is a 32-bit development board based on the high performance Renesas RA4M1 (Arm Cortex®-M4). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a clock speed of 48 MHz, a USB-C® connection, as well as pins featuring SPI, I2C and one CAN bus.

The UNO R4 WiFi features a total of 32 KB of SRAM and an additional 256 KB of flash memory. It also has a DAC pin which can be used to create more complex sound outputs and being part of the UNO family it comes with the perks of having a wide range of compatibilities regarding shields and libraries.

On top of all of this it comes fitted with a secondary microcontroller, the ESP32-S3, that gives the board WiFi and Bluetooth™️ functionality, and an 8x12 programmable LED matrix to display anything you want.
