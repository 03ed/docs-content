The Arduino UNO R4 Minima is the first UNO board featuring a 32-bit microcontroller. With a new architecture based on the RA4M1 MCU from [Renesas](https://www.renesas.com/us/en), it is faster with its 48 MHz clock, has a lot more memory and brings new features such as a built-in RTC, DAC, HID support, CAN bus, JTAG connector and more.

The board still features the classic barrel jack plug, with an improved voltage input range (6-24V), but replaces the old USB connector with a USB-C type connector. The UNO R4 Minima remains on a 5V operating voltage, making it hardware compatible with shields, accessories or circuits designed for older UNO revisions.
