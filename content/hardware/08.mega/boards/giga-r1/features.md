<FeatureDescription>

The **GIGA R1** is an advanced development board featuring the same amount of GPIOs as the predecessors, [Mega2560]() and [Due](). It is based on the STM32XXX microcontroller, and uses a similar architecture as the [Portenta H7]() which is based on the same chip.

With USB-C, USB-A, Audio, Camera, JTAG & MIPI connectors, this board enables a lot of smooth interfacing with external components. It can be used for AI applications such as computer vision with its fast microcontroller and compatibility with the [OpenMV]() platform. With two DAC channels connected to the audio jack, it can be transformed into a professional music instrument.
