The GIGA R1 WiFi is a powerful, feature-packed & an all-you-can-connect GPIO board. Based on the [STM32H747XI]() micro and part of our [mbed]() boards, the GIGA R1 WiFi features XX GPIOs, a [dual core processor](), advanced [audio]() capabilities as well as camera & display connectors. 

**Note:** the GIGA R1 WiFi is almost identical to the [GIGA R1](), but is shipped with a Wi-Fi module and a cryptochip. Therefor, everything that is supported on the [GIGA R1]() is also supported on the GIGA R1 WiFi.
