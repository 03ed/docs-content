The **GIGA R1 WiFi** is a powerful, feature-packed board with a large amount of GPIOs and dedicated connectors. Based on the [STM32H747XI](/resources/datasheets/stm32h747xi.pdf) micro based on the [Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/), the GIGA R1 WiFi features 75 GPIOs, a [dual core processor](/tutorials/giga-r1/giga-dual-core), [advanced ADC/DAC](/tutorials/giga-r1/giga-audio) features as well as camera & display connectors. It also has a rich [USB interface](/tutorials/giga-r1/giga-usb) with support for HID via USB-C and USBHost (keyboard, mass storage) via a dedicated USB-A connector.

**Please Note:** The [GIGA R1](/hardware/giga-r1) & [GIGA R1 WiFi](/hardware/giga-r1-wifi) are identical except for the onboard Wi-Fi/BLE module & crypto chip. In the documentation, we refer to the board simply as **GIGA R1**, except for documentation related to the Wi-Fi/BLE module.
