<FeatureDescription>

The GIGA Display Shield comes with a 3.97” 480x800 RGB touch screen, a digital microphone and on-board IMU, that can easily be mounted on the GIGA R1 WiFi board. An arducam connector is located at the top of the shield.

Using the fast dual core microcontroller (480MHz / 240MHz) of the GIGA R1 WiFi powerful visual solutions can be developed using the LVGL library or the ArduinoGraphics library.
