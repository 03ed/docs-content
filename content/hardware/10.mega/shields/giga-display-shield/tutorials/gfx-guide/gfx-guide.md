The [GIGA Display Shield](/hardware/giga-display-shield) is compatible with the [Adafruit_GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) graphics core library.

To access it, we have a library called [Arduino_GigaDisplay_GFX](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_GigaDisplay_GFX) designed specifically for the shield. In this guide, we will get started with some of the essential methods of the library, that will allow us to e.g. print values, text, draw shapes.

## Goals

In this guide we will cover:
- Learn how to draw and print to the display,
- how to draw basic shapes (circles, rectangles etc)
- how to update values on the screen,

## Hardware & Software Needed

- [GIGA R1 WiFi](/hardware/giga-r1).
- [GIGA Display Shield](/hardware/giga-display-shield)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Installation

First, open the Arduino IDE and search for the **Arduino_GigaDisplay_GFX** library in the **Library Manager**.
