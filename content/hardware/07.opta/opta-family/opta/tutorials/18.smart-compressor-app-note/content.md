## Introduction

Transform your industrial compressor into smart and connect it to the Arduino Cloud for advanced condition monitoring capabilities using the Opta micro PLC.

![Project Thumbnail]()

This affordable solution provides real-time remote data access, behavioral diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and efficient device management. It helps you maximize uptime, reduce operational costs, and extend the lifespan of your equipment.

### Goals

The goal of this application note is to showcase the Opta PLC capabilities on letting you convert conventional industrial equipment into smart for monitoring and predictive maintenance purposes. The project's objectives are the following:

- Monitor key performance indicators like power consumption, temperature and pressure of the compressor.
- Integrate additional sensing points into your assets like vibration for motor and bearings status control. 
- Connect the compressor via Modbus TCP industry-standard protocol for optional integration to currently installed systems.
- Leverage Arduino Cloud's powerful analytics to gain actionable insights into the compressor performance.
- Create an Arduino Cloud dashboard that syncs in real time to inform and alert the user.
