MicroPython is an implementation of the popular Python programming language, with a target for microcontrollers (hence the "micro").

Python has become one of the most popular languages worldwide, with one of its key characteristics is being a easier language to learn. This makes it suitable for beginners that have little to no experience in writing text-based code, but want to achieve great things.

## Nano ESP32 / MicroPython Pinout

The pins used in MicroPython is very different from what the pin numbering on your board states. In the pinout below, you can see in **green**, which pin you need to use when using MicroPython.

Why is there a difference in pins? The MicroPython implementation follows the pin numbering on the ESP32-S3, just so it is compatible with all other boards based on the ESP32-S3.

Therefor it is necessary to keep track on two sets of pins:
- The **Nano ESP32 pins** which are labeled on the board.
- The **MicroPython pins** which are used in the code.

## The MicroPython Environment

MicroPython includes the standard Python API, but also a series of modules that is hardware specific. After you have installed it in your board, commands written in Python that you send to the board will be executed directly.

This is quite different from the "standard" Arduino (C++) way of programming, where you compile your code before sending it to your board. The MicroPython way allows you to change the program instantly. 

Using MicroPython, we don't write sketches, we write **scripts**. A script can be written in a [MicroPython compatible editor](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython) which can then be saved on the board. To send a script, you need to have the board connected to your computer.

Since MicroPython implements a filesystem, you can access this similar to how you access a USB drive.

## MicroPython Editor

A MicroPython editor is a special code editor with built-in functions for communicating with your board. 

There are several editors available, but in this course, we will use the [Arduino Lab for MicroPython](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython).

***The [next chapter](/micropython-course/course/installation) is dedicated to using the Arduino Lab for MicroPython editor.*** 

## What is a Script?

A MicroPython script is a piece of code that can be run on your board. It could contain just the simplest mathematic equation, `1+1` (which is 2), or a script that controls a robotic arm that serves you a cup of tea.

Inside a MicroPython editor, you simply write the code you want to run, and click on the **"Play"** button. If there is anything wrong with your code, you will receive an error. If not, it will run the instructions in the scripts.

## Loops

If you have plenty of experience in Arduino, you will be used to the concept of a **loop**. This is not a requirement when using MicroPython. You can write a program that either just run once, or continues to loop over and over.

To make a program loop continuously, you will need to use a **while loop** inside your script.

```python
while(True):
    # code placed here will execute over and over again
    # in a similar fashion to the void loop() function
```

## Main & Boot Files

There are two files that are important to consider in the MicroPython environment:
- `boot.py` - a script that will run as the board starts (with other words, *boots*).
- `main.py` - a script that will run immediately after `main.py`.

You can consider `main.py` file to be your "main" script as it will execute any time after the board boots. Inside a MicroPython editor, we can open this file and edit it directly. When we save, we save it to the board, and the instructions are updated! 

This is a bit different if you are used to programming Arduino boards using the Arduino IDE / C++, because there you need to compile and upload for every change you make.

## REPL

The **REPL**, also referred often as the **terminal**, is a command line interface inside your editor. When you input an instruction, or a message, the *interpeter* on your Arduino will evaluate it, and return the result.

You could for example write `1+1`, which the REPL will reply with a `2`. This computation is performed on your Arduino, and sent back to you!

When we run a script, and don't worry, we will come back to this topic, we can use the `print()` function to print things in the REPL. This is a great way of knowing what goes on on your board. An example is:

```python
print(1+1)
print("Computation performed, yay!")
```
